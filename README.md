# Rekit boilerplate
In previous version Rekit boilerplate was shaped together with Rekit package which makes it's hard to update the boilerplate. Now it's separated so that you don't need to upgrade the global Rekit command frequently.

The boilerplate will be published as a zip package and Rekit command line tool will download it and unzip to generate a new app.
